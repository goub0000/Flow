# Alternative: Let Nixpacks auto-detect Python setup
# Just delete nixpacks.toml and rely on:
# - requirements.txt (auto-detected)
# - Procfile or railway.toml for start command
# - runtime.txt for Python version

# If the current config fails, delete nixpacks.toml 
# and Nixpacks will handle everything automatically
