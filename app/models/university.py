LEGACY FILE - NO LONGER USED

This file contained SQLAlchemy ORM models for the local SQLite database.
The system has been migrated to 100% cloud-based architecture using Supabase.

All data models are now defined in Supabase PostgreSQL database schema.
Database operations use the Supabase Python client instead of SQLAlchemy.

See:
- app/database/config.py for Supabase connection
- app/api/ for API endpoints using Supabase client
